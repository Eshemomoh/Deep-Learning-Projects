To run python script, make sure all the liberaries required are installed in the python environment. 

Required libraries are

1) Numpy
2) Matplotlib
3) Tensorflow 2.0
4) Sklearn (for computing confusion matrix)

- load the validation or testing table by modifying the data path according to where you have the data in your machine
- load the model using the path included in the run_file or change if needed

My computer is unable to process the entire validation data through the model hence I provided two methods.
	1) If your machine is unable to process entire validation through the model, use the FIRST APPROACH and then move on to plotting the confucion matrix and accuracy.
	2) If your machine is able to process entire data, use SECOND APPROACH and then move on to plotting the confusion matrix and accuracy.
